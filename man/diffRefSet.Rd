\alias{diffRefSet}
\title{Restrict refset to differentially methylated probes
use with care, might introduce bias}
\usage{
diffRefSet(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{a matrix with probes on the rows and cell types on the columns}
}
\value{
g a matrix with a subset of input probes (rows)
}
\description{
The function takes a matrix with probes on the rows and cell types on
the columns and output a subset matrix and only probes that show
discordant methylation levels among the cell types.
}
\examples{
g <- diffRefSet(getRefSet(platform='HM450'))
}
